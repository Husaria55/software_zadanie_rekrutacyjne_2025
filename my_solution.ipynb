    "## Description of the core idea\n",
    "\n",
    "My idea was to create a more realistic physics model of the rocket. The problematic part was to find the neccessary data like mass of the rocket, drag coefficient, etc. Even though I found quite comprehesive description of the similar projects to AGH Space Systems, still I would have to think up some values for the physics model. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I decided to code something more like physics sandbox, where you can control the physics constants and see how the rocket behaves. To add some fun to this I decided that every possible constant should be controllable by the user. So that if somebody wants to simulate something like moon conditions, he could set drag coefficient to 0 and gravity to 1/6 of Earth's gravity. "

    "3. In the tcp_simulator.py file, there is an option in terminal to set the variables, the default values are similar to SKYLARK rocket from AGH Space Systems. Some variables are just guesses, as they were not provided in the description of the rocket on internet site.\n",

    "To simulate a rocket model, we need a set of variables that define the rocket and its environment, and a set of equations that describe the forces acting on it. The simulation's core is Newton's Second Law ($F=ma$), but applied to a system where mass is not constant. We must use numerical integration, as the forces are not constant. This means we'll calculate the rocket's state (position, velocity, mass) in small time steps (e.g., every $\\Delta t = 0.01$ seconds). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the variables and equations for a standard 1D (vertical) flight simulation, we assume 1D motion for simplicity."
